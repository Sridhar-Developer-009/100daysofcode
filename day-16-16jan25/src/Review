Since ,Today I've only focused on only quantity of my coding progress.I realized that I need to focus on the quality of learning.
By the time while I writing this,It is jan20 so I've skipped 3 days of active learning.I ensure more quality of work completion rather than completing it in a day basis.
Everything is a learning.Let's keep doing!
