keep in mind....

time 1:24pm->now I tried a pattern problem pattern12 in two ways
Both codes are for printing patterns, but they differ in how they approach the task.

Code 1 (linesofcodeshort):
Uses Recursion: The pattern function calls itself recursively to print the first part of the pattern and then switches directions.
Dynamic Direction Change: The up boolean flag controls whether the pattern is printed upwards or downwards, and it changes after the first half of the pattern.
Single Function Call: The pattern logic is handled in one function, pattern, which uses recursion.

Code 2 (pattern12):
No Recursion: It uses iterative loops in two separate functions—pattern for the top half and patterndown for the bottom half.
Structured Approach: It clearly divides the logic into two parts: one for the top and another for the bottom half of the pattern.

Comparison:
Readability: The second code is easier to read because it separates the logic into two distinct functions, making it clearer what each part of the program is doing.
Efficiency: The first code uses recursion, which can be less efficient for large inputs due to the overhead of recursive calls. The second code uses simple loops, which are typically more efficient for tasks like pattern printing.
Flexibility: The first code’s recursive approach is more flexible for variations in pattern logic, but it may be more complex to maintain.
Which is better?
For simplicity and clarity, the second code (pattern12) is better.
For learning recursion or creating more dynamic patterns, the first code (linesofcodeshort) offers more flexibility and complexity.
If your goal is to understand recursion and its usage in pattern printing, the first code is a good choice. If you want a simple and effective solution, the second code is more efficient and easier to follow.
